* Move up and down sections and options
* Option groups. Group of options that are placed inside the same tk.LabelFrame
* Graphical dependencies editor
* Sections dependencies (a section activation depending on an option value)
* Option type displaying a radio buttons group (instead of a combo box)
* Option type displaying a checkbuttons group for multiple selection (List option type)
* Idea: a section subsections could be displayed with a tk.Notebook widget, in different tags in the section editing screen.
* Configurator configuration using Configurator (bootstrap)
* Configurations editing layout configuration (for instance, whether to display subsections as tab or not, etc). This should be serialized as a <settings> in the configurator.config file.
